CLINICAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN THE STUDENT BENEFITS UNIT OF THE DIRECTORATE OF STUDENT AFFAIRS OF THE PUCV

Fichaube is a web application aimed at managing clinical records of the Student Welfare Unit. These documents are unique to each student, and their content is confidential, so only certain people can access it. Given that the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso (PUCV) provides a medical and social service to its students, the organization must have these files, in order to be able to monitor the situation of the students and comply with Chilean health regulations. .

Implemented and Designed by: Macarena Gárate Muñoz and Francisco Tapia Fontecilla.
